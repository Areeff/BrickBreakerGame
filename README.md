# BrickBreakerGame
Itâ€™s a GUI-based project used with the swing library to organize all the elements that work under the Brick Breaker game.
Use the left, and right keys to move the paddle left and right.
The current score is updated every time the ball hits the brick and displayed.
Game over if the ball does not hit the paddle and goes out of the border.
The player wins when all bricks are broken.
